    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cabbage confirms its status as one of the vegetable kingdom’s most versatile ingredients in this untraditional yet deeply comforting dish. Roasted at high temperature, the cabbage becomes sweet and smoky, providing a complex vegetarian foundation for the classic parmesan treatment often applied to eggplant or mushrooms. The traditional bread crumbs are replaced with chunky croutons, which deliver a textural crunch — and it’s a good idea to make extra, for soaking up the sauce or even just for snacking. Experiment with different varieties of cabbage; conical Caraflex will deliver a sweeter finish, while savoy, with its looser leaf structure, has a milder flavor and can cook in less time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1 medium green cabbage (about 2½ pounds), cut into 2-inch wedges</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>½ pound bread, such as sourdough or ciabatta, torn into1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
        <li>3 cups/24 ounces store-bought or homemade tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups/8 ounces grated low-moisture mozzarella</li>
        <li>Basil leaves, for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 450 degrees and arrange racks in the middle and bottom of the oven.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a sheet pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil and then arrange the cabbage wedges on the pan, setting each one flat. Drizzle the top and sides of the cabbage with 3 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place onto the middle rack of the oven and roast until tender and golden, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the bread on another sheet pan. Add the garlic, drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss well to coat evenly. Place on the bottom rack of the oven and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, toss the croutons and return to the oven until golden and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cabbage from the oven and spoon the tomato sauce on top. Top with the mozzarella and return to the oven until the cheese is melted and golden, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, scatter croutons and basil leaves on top and drizzle with more olive oil. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
